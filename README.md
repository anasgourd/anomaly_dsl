# AnomalyDSL â€” Diploma Thesis Project

This repository contains the implementation of **AnomalyDSL**, a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) 
for anomaly detection pipelines in streaming data.  

It was developed as part of my Diploma Thesis at the **School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki**.
